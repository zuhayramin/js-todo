# To-Do app to practice CRUD operations

HTML and CSS Design borrowed from [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhmSidOJSeE)

This application was built with the help of Google, Youtube and chatGPT.

The purpose of this application was to make an application which could perform CRUD operations

CREATE: You can create new lists and tasks. 
READ: You can see all the lists and tasks you have created, and they are saved in localstorage, so no matter how many times you close the browser, your lists will always be upto date. 
UPDATE: There is an update button at the end of each task, in case of typos. 
DELETE: You can delete completed tasks, or even entire lists
